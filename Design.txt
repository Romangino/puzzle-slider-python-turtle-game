For my final project puzzle slider there were some decisions I made that would affect what I later did in the program.
I decided to make three main classes that would handle the whole project. BoardLayout, PuzzleClicks, and Leaderboard.

The BoardLayout class took care of the static graphics of the board as well as the screens that would be used when an
event like a loss, win or quit. This helped me keep organize, but later I would have to call BoardLayout methods in
other classes which made it more confusing in the end since I needed to import other classes for other classes to be
able to use their methods.

In PuzzleClicks I took care of all the changing puzzle components such as player moves, puzzle loading, and thumbnail. I
used turtle to be each of my puzzle pieces which made swapping pieces a lot easier for me. The only problem I can see
arising is that the last turtle will always be my blank but the puzzles file format might not account for this, so it
would have been better to somehow assign the turtle to the string of text correlating to where the location of the image
piece is. I also decided to use the shuffled list to keep track of the order of the pieces and had to swap the positions
of the list elements when I swapped a puzzle piece. I also didn't need the name for the class since it was only used
once the player won it would be plugged into the Leaderboard class with the moves taken.

In the Leaderboard class since I was having trouble sorting the ranking I eventually turned the leaderboard data into a
nested list so that I could use the sorted function with a lambda temp function to sort each of the items by moves. I
then used this to write my leaderboard.
